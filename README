Software Heritage storage test data
===================================

How to recreate the DB dumps
----------------------------

TL;DR: make -C swh-environment rebuild-testdata

Periodically you will need to recreate the test data DB dumps, e.g., after a
change in the DB schema. To that end:

1. you should first ensure that the `softwareheritage-dev` contains the status
   of the DB that you want to use in tests. You can achieve that by running
   (all commands are relative to swh-environment/ development root)

        make -C swh-storage/sql/ distclean filldb

2. recreate the DB dumps in this repository

        make -C swh-storage-testdata/ distclean dumpdb

3. check the textual diff of the SQL dump, to ensure it contains the
   differences you want:

        cd swh-storage-testdata
        git diff dumps/swh.sql

4. commit and push your changes

        git commit
        git push

As a shortcut for steps (1) and (2), you can use Makefile target
`rebuild-testdata` in swh-environment/Makefile
